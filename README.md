# Fun with Flags App 
### (Updated and 'translated' from Python into PHP)

Web app, at first made as study Python project with so many stupid bugs and now rebuild on PHP.
If I ever have my own web server, I'll place a link here.

Still hoped to be redesigned one day...


## Installation

Well, to make this work look through `collect.py`, to create database from the data about countries from `data.txt`. Then to make different complexity levels avialable complete database with estimating complexity of countries using `complexity.py`.

##Advantages

First of all it is much better than previous version:
	* you can not see Flag_og_Argentina.svg in HTML anymore, no hints
	* no bugs on refreshing page, end of session and forgetting progress when leaving quiz
	* refreshing random country page does not change country..
	* works fine for me, on my difficult level I'm absolutely dumb
And in general it is quite working, I can replace flags and countries with paintings and artists one day, or add capitals(there already capitals in my database).

## Disadvantages
=============
Well,
	- design is awful, sometimes flas are squeezed, and I hate colors
	- I think there's better way to organise code
	- no mobile version
