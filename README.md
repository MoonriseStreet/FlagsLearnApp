# Fun with Flags App 
### (Updated and 'translated' from Python into PHP)

Web app, at first made as study Python project with so many stupid bugs and now rebuild on PHP.
If I ever have my own web server, I'll place a link here.

Still hoped to be redesigned one day...


## Installation

Well, to make this work look through `collect.py`, to create database from the data about countries from `data.txt`. Then to make different complexity levels avialable complete database with estimating complexity of countries using `complexity.py`.

## Advantages

First of all it is much better than previous version:

	 1. you can not see Flag_og_Argentina.svg in HTML anymore, no hints
	 2. no bugs on refreshing page, end of session and forgetting progress when leaving quiz
	 3. refreshing random country page does not change country..
	 4. works fine for me, on my difficult level I'm absolutely dumb

And in general it is quite working, I can replace flags and countries with paintings and artists one day, or add capitals(there already capitals in my database).

## Disadvantages
Well,

	 - design is awful, sometimes flas are squeezed, and I hate colors

	 - I think there's better way to organise code

	 - no mobile version
